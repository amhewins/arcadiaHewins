      <p class="entry">
        I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania named Coopersburg. <br>
        I am an only child with a big extended family. <br>

      <h3 class="entry">Where I've Been</h3>
      <p class="entry">
        I went to Bethlehem Catholic High School. <br>
        I played softball for the Becahi Golden Hawks. <br>
        I was also the editor of the yearbook. <br>
        Costa Rica was my all-time favorite vacation. <br>
        I have also been to Yellowstone. <br>
        And the Smoky Mountains. <br>
        Multiple times I've visited family in Wisconsin. <br>
        I went to Chicago just to see the baseball stadiums. <br>
        And I've been to every state that touches Pennsylvania. <br>
        We used to vacation in North Carolina and still do some holidays down there. <br>
        I went to Disney for the first time in 2016.

      <!--Currently-->
      <h3 class="entry">Where I Am</h3>
      <p class="entry">
        I study Interactive Design and Development. <br>
        I go to Philadelphia University and live in Roxborough. <br>
        According to the Myers Brigg's test, I am an <strong>INFJ</strong>. <br>
        I am very organized and actually enjoy cleaning. (Yes really) <br>
        All time favorite TV show is <strong>The Office</strong>. <br>
        My music taste includes a wide variety-my favorite is between Folk, Bluegrass, and Indie. <br>
        I used to play fastpitch softball and now I play on adult slowpitch teams. <br>
        I have a puppy named Rosalita who is a Golden Retriever. <br>
        My favorite number is <strong>8</strong>-mostly because I was born on the 8<sup>th</sup> of February. <br>
        Speaking of my birthday: I was born in 1996 so I am currently <strong>21 years old</strong>. <br>
        This summer I am hostessing in Grant Village at Yellowstone National Park. <br>
        Check out my website dedicated to my summer <a href="yellowstone.html">here!</a> <br>

      <!--Going-->
      <h3 class="entry">Where I'm Going</h3>
      <p class="entry">
        My hope is to be a Web Developer in Philadelphia or another major city. <br>
        But that's not to say I'm closed off to other opportunities. <br>
        I'm just seeing where life takes me and trusting that I will end up where I need to be. <br>
        Don't they say if you shoot for the moon, you'll land among the stars? <br>
        Well that's what I'm doing. <br>
        I'll get to where I need to be when I need to be there. <br>
