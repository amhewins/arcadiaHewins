        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania named Coopersburg. <br>
          I am an only child with a big extended family. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
        <p>
          I went to Bethlehem Catholic High School. <br>
          I played softball for the Becahi Golden Hawks. <br>
          I was also the editor of the yearbook. <br>
          Costa Rica was my all-time favorite vacation. <br>
          I have also been to Yellowstone. <br>
          And the Smoky Mountains. <br>
          Multiple times I've visited family in Wisconsin. <br>
          I went to Chicago just to see the baseball stadiums. <br>
          And I've been to every state that touches Pennsylvania. <br>
          We used to vacation in North Carolina and still do some holidays down there. <br>
          I went to Disney for the first time in 2016.
        </p>
        <h2>Where I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I study Interactive Design and Development. <br>
          I go to Philadelphia University and live in Roxborough. <br>
          According to the Myers Brigg's test, I am an <strong>INFJ</strong>. <br>
          I am very organized and actually enjoy cleaning. (Yes really) <br>
          All time favorite TV show is <strong>The Office</strong>. <br>
          My music taste includes a wide variety-my favorite is between Folk, Bluegrass, and Indie. <br>
          I used to play fastpitch softball and now I play on adult slowpitch teams. <br>
          I have a puppy named Rosalita who is a Golden Retriever. <br>
          My favorite number is <strong>8</strong>-mostly because I was born on the 8<sup>th</sup> of February. <br>
          Speaking of my birthday: I was born in 1996 so I am currently <strong>21 years old</strong>. <br>
          This summer I will be hostessing in Grant Village at Yellowstone National Park. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
        <p>
          My hope is to be a Web Developer in Philadelphia or another major city. <br>
          But that's not to say I'm closed off to other opportunities. <br>
          I'm just seeing where life takes me and trusting that I will end up where I need to be. <br>
          Don't they say if you shoot for the moon, you'll land among the stars? <br>
          Well that's what I'm doing. <br>
          I'll get to where I need to be when I need to be there. <br>
