      <p class="entry">
        	&nbsp &nbsp I started off my journey on May 9th being seen off by my parents at the Greyhound station in Philadelphia. We went out for a brunch before I officially started my summer and then I soaked up as much time with my dog as I could before driving south to the beginning of a three-day bus ride. On the outside I was excited to get out to Yellowstone, but I remember looking at my mom when they called for my bus. I walked across the terminal and got in line. We had time to wait for people to get off the bus so I called my parents over to stand with me for a few more minutes. It was harder than I thought to get on the bus – this officially is the longest and farthest I’ve been from home. Not that I need my parents, but I genuinely enjoy spending time with them. I’m happy with my decision to go to school an hour away from home and I’m happy that I took this opportunity to go across the country for the summer.
	<br> &nbsp &nbsp We first went down to Maryland before heading through Pittsburg and up to Ohio. In Ohio a boy about my age got on the bus with luggage comparable to mine and when we had a layover in Chicago, I went up to him and asked where he was going. Surprisingly he was headed out to Yellowstone too. I would later find out that he was going to work in Old Faithful, but it was nice to have someone to travel with. We took turns watching each other’s luggage during our layovers and helped each other get single seats. It worked most of the time because I only had to share a seat with someone for three hours – but may I say that was probably the worst three hours of the trip. Not sharing a seat meant being able to sprawl out a bit more and having a few more hours of sleep. And by a few more hours, I mean I got about ten throughout the three days. Most of my time was spent reading, listening to music, journaling, and watching The Office. Greyhound claims there is wifi on their buses, but sadly it never worked so I started disconnecting that first day, and man did it feel good.
	<br> &nbsp &nbsp One time I rode a Greyhound and the charging ports on one side of the bus were out so since that time, I make sure I’m prepared by charging my devices before I transfer busses and using them sparingly. Thank gosh I did because when my new friend and I transferred from Greyhound to Jefferson Lines halfway through the trip, we found that the bus that we were to take for 15 hours was an older model without power plugs. The seats were uncomfortable so no one was going to get any sleep and many passengers didn’t realize that there were no outlets so they used up the power on their phone within hours of the trip. When people started asking about power, others realized the dilemma. I, on the other hand, had my laptop to charge my phone and tablet. So that night, I was able to switch from listening to music and reading for the majority of the 15 hours. I read an entire book that trip.
	<br> &nbsp &nbsp That specific bus dropped us off at Billings, MT and then was the longest hour and a half layover before catching the last bus to Bozeman, MT. Everyone flocked to the few outlets the terminal had. I spent most of the time on the phone with my parents catching them up and letting them know where I was. Finally the bus pulled in, but the driver needed an hour break before continuing so Betty (that’s what the driver named the coach) sat there tormenting me until finally we were able to board. A few hours later we pulled into the Walmart parking lot and it was time for me and my friend to exit the bus. I spent the entire ride comfortable about my decision, but when we pulled into Bozeman, I had a fleeting “what the f*** did I decide to do?!”. The hotel I was staying in was a little over a quarter mile from the bus stop so I made the trek by myself because my friend needed to go shopping. I had my priorities straight – shower then shopping. It was hot in Bozeman so I arrived to the front desk with greasy hair, no makeup, sweaty, and just reeking of that travel smell. I got my key card (to the first hotel room I would be staying in alone ever) and hiked up the stairs with all my stuff (no, they did not have an elevator and of course I was on the second floor), but then I opened the door to my private hotel room. That was my last night of no roommate and I was going to live it up. I sprawled out on the king sized bed, took a shower, felt human again, went to Walmart, grabbed a pillow, food, and some snacks, returned to my room, put on The Office, and was asleep by 9pm.
	<br> &nbsp &nbsp The next morning, I woke up way before my alarm because I was anxious to start my summer. I got ready, put on the outfit that took me a little longer than it should have to pick out, then got out to where the bus was to pick us up. I was third in line behind a man with a bunch of camouflage luggage and one who had one backpack only. I immediately thought that I brought way too much stuff until I saw a group of girls that left the hotel at the same time. They had between three and six things of luggage each in which I felt better about having a suitcase, duffle bag, and backpack (you can read about my packing adventures below). It was awkwardly quiet for a few minutes before one of the girls started asking everyone questions like what their name was, where they were from, where they would be working… That’s where I met my roommate for the summer and one of my closest friends. In that circle was Rachel, Claire, Rose, Kathryn, and Tessa. We found out that Claire and Rose were cousins, Rachel and Claire were in sororities, and we were all going to be working in the Grant Village Restaurant (except for Tessa – but that’s another story). Finally the bus pulled up and everyone got on. We all sat one to a seat until we realized how many people were behind us in line. That’s when Rachel asked if I wanted to sit with her. So there we were – all of us sitting around each other for the eight-hour day that was ahead of us. We drove from Bozeman to Gardiner for check in. That’s where we got our uniforms, nametag, ID card, and got our first taste of Yellowstone. From there, we took to the road again and our next stop was Old Faithful to drop off half of the bus. From there, we had an hour and a half left until we arrived at Grant Village.
	<br> &nbsp &nbsp So from May 9th until late in the afternoon on May 12th, I got from Pennsylvania to Grant Village safe and sound. I’m just happy that my dad found a flight for me to get home in 24 hours instead of five days that it would take by bus.

      <p class="entry">
        	&nbsp &nbsp Wherever you work you always get a diverse group of people. Being out here in Yellowstone I expected all the people to be like-minded and alike in style, but there are so many different walks of life out here. As one of my managers once said, “everyone out here is either looking for something or running from something.” As dramatic as that may seem, when you start talking to people you seem to understand that that truly is the case. I wanted to get off the east coast and away from where I’ve spent 21 years of my life. I craved a new environment, new people, and a temporary escape from what is ‘reality’ for the next year at least. I have one more year of college and then I don’t know where life could take me.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbspWorking with people in the “real world” is a completely different ballgame than working with people here. Back home you have people you see at work and then you can go home and get separation. Here, you live with the people you work with. You don’t have “work friends” and “family friends” and “school friends”, everyone here is all of that to you. You become a family, especially when you work in a village as small as Grant. But it’s one of the biggest testaments to leaving things where they are meant to be-if you have a problem with someone in life, you leave it at the door. And if you have a problem with someone at work, don’t bring it home with you.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbsp The stories I could tell about co-workers……

      <!--Office-->
      <h3 class="entry" id="office">'Office' Nights</h3>
      <p class="entry">
        	&nbsp &nbsp While some people think that a fun night involves drinking and going out, I think my favorite nights were with friends in a dorm room watching The Office for hours on end. At first it started with me watching it alone in my room because I didn’t know if people would be in to watching TV while in Yellowstone. Then I started hearing people talking about how much they missed watching it – so I was more than happy to share! Most of the time it was watching it with Kathryn laying on her floor eating junk food and that’s some of my favorite memories. We would quote nearly 90% of the show and laugh until we cried. Watching it with Kathryn and Brooklynn was the funniest thing because Brooklynn had never seen The Office and while she was trying to listen, she had to deal with the laughter coming from Kathryn and myself. We also had one night where we set it up in the dorm lobby and had about ten people huddled around my laptop for hours just laughing together.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbsp Normally when people have their last nights, we have a party at the pub (more information on that below), but Kathryn made the great decision to just get a last calzone from the pub and watching The Office until we had to go to work at 5:30 in the morning. Sadly we both fell asleep around three in the morning, but we had one of the best times doing so. Our RC Cassey came in for a bit and couldn’t handle the two of us.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbsp Do I regret bringing my laptop with The Office? Absolutely not. While I wanted to spend most of my free time socializing or reading, it was a nice break and a nice way to spend time with friends or after a rough shift.

      <p class="entry">
        	&nbsp &nbsp One of the first conversations that we had in the first couple days was about the tattoos that people wanted to get while in the park. Little did we know in the blink of an eye it would be time to get them. We planned for mid-July so that it would be before anyone left, but give us some time to have a design sink in and find a nice place to go to. So Kathryn and I took a trip with our friend Jessi to scope out some places in Bozeman. There was only one place open on Sundays (which is when we found time to go) and the feeling we got when we walked in felt right. So we made appointments for July 13th. Another blink of an eye and we were in the car driving up with a three hour trip ahead of us.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbsp There were five people on the trip and four of us were getting tattoos. It was me, Brooklynn, Kathryn, Audrey, and Rose. We all had ideas of what we wanted, but put it up to the artist to make it real. Kathryn went first with a simple line of mountains on her side. I followed with more detailed mountains on my inner right foot. Then Brooklynn had to outdo us and got a tree stump with wild flowers around it on her inner right arm.
	        <br> &nbsp &nbsp My tattoo was my most painful because the foot is all nerves and pressure points, but I am so happy that I got it there and put up with the pain. Heck my parents even both like it. I know where I’m going to get my next one, but for now the three I have are good enough.

      <p class="entry">
        	&nbsp &nbsp I came out west with one suitcase, a duffle, and a backpack. Being out here I’ve realized what I need to live life and what I didn’t even miss. About a month in to my summer, I started making a list of things I could get rid of at home. This, along with some Pinterest research when at the coffee shop in Jackson, I can think of 25% of things I have at my parents’ house that I really don’t need. My scale is one thing. People out here don’t care about how much they weigh-they care about living life. Most of the things are clothes. It’s so much easier to have few clothes and mix and match them as you go along. I know the second I get home I am going to go through all my things and try to get rid of half the things I own-it’s so freeing. To be able to pick up and go and not have to be bogged down by all the things I own-actually what is owning me.
